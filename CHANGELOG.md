## 2.5.0
- **Robust Enum Normalization**: Refactored normalization to use dynamic schema introspection for all enum fields and values. Now supports automatic camelCase conversion for all enums, regardless of field name.
- **Field-to-Enum Mapping**: Added automatic mapping of GraphQL fields to their enum types using introspection, ensuring all enum fields are normalized.
- **SDK Cleanup**: Removed all debug prints, centralized normalization logic, and improved recursion for speed and maintainability.
- **DRY & Fast**: Refactored normalization to avoid duplicate logic and unnecessary recursion, making it production-grade and easy to extend.
- **No Breaking Changes**: All existing APIs remain compatible, but normalization is now more reliable and future-proof.

## 2.4.0
- **Enhanced Language Code Support**: Improved dynamic language code handling with proper URI parsing instead of string concatenation.
- **Dynamic Channel Token Management**: Added `setChannelToken()` and `getChannelToken()` methods for runtime channel switching.
- **Better URI Handling**: Fixed URI construction to properly handle existing query parameters and language codes in endpoints.
- **New Static Methods**: Added `setLanguageCode()`, `getLanguageCode()`, `setChannelToken()`, and `getChannelToken()` for dynamic configuration.
- **Preserved Original Endpoints**: When no language code is set, the original endpoint URL is preserved as-is without modification.
- **Multi-tenant Support**: Enhanced support for multi-channel applications with dynamic channel token switching.

## 2.3.0
- Updated `graphql` package to latest compatible version.
- Fixed async/generic bug in `mutate` for bool and map return types.
- Improved type safety and error handling for all custom operations.
- All previous bugfixes and enum normalization improvements included.

## 2.2.0
- Improved error handling for all Vendure error types (e.g. InvalidCredentialsError, ErrorResult, etc.) so authentication failures always throw a standardized, testable message.
- Defensive null checks for error messages to prevent type errors.
- Enum normalization restored: all enum values for keys in `_vendureTypeEnums` are now converted to Dart/camelCase style recursively.
- Type safety enforced for all map responses.
- Internal logging and debug improvements for error diagnosis.
- See `normalizeGraphQLData` and authentication methods for details.

## 2.1.1
- Added refresh token via Vendure instance: `Vendure.instance.refreshToken(params)` now available for direct use.
- Makes token refresh accessible from the singleton instance for all auth flows.

## 2.1.0
- Added refresh token support via `TokenManager` and `Vendure.refreshToken`.
- You can now refresh authentication tokens dynamically for long-lived sessions or custom auth flows.
- See `Vendure.refreshToken` and `TokenManager` for usage.

## 2.0.0
### ⚠️ Breaking Change
- `CustomOperations` API: The `fromJson` parameter is now optional for `mutate`, `query`, `queryList`, and `mutateList` methods.
- If `fromJson` is not provided, the raw normalized data is returned (cast to the expected type).
- This change breaks previous usage where `fromJson` was required.
- Update your code to handle the new method signatures and return types.

## 1.8.0

## 1.7.1
- fixed enum value conversion in _convertEnumToDartFormat method
- improved handling of camelCase enum values (e.g., 'staticVal' now correctly preserved instead of being converted to 'staticval')
- method now properly handles both SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE and camelCase enum formats
